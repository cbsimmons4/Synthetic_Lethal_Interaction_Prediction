	abstract = {The development and application of genetic tools and resources has enabled a partial genetic-interaction network for the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to be compiled. Analysis of the network, which is ongoing, has already provided a clear picture of the nature and scale of the genetic interactions that robustly sustain biological systems, and how cellular buffering is achieved at the molecular level. Recent studies in yeast have begun to define general principles of genetic networks, and also pave the way for similar studies in metazoan model systems. A comparative understanding of genetic-interaction networks promises insights into some long-standing genetic problems, such as the nature of quantitative traits and the basis of complex inherited disease.},

	abstract = {We generated a global genetic interaction network for Saccharomyces cerevisiae, constructing more than 23 million double mutants, identifying about 550,000 negative and about 350,000 positive genetic interactions. This comprehensive network maps genetic interactions for essential gene pairs, highlighting essential genes as densely connected hubs. Genetic interaction profiles enabled assembly of a hierarchical model of cell function, including modules corresponding to protein complexes and pathways, biological processes, and cellular compartments. Negative interactions connected functionally related genes, mapped core bioprocesses, and identified pleiotropic genes, whereas positive interactions often mapped general regulatory connections among gene pairs, rather than shared functionality. The global network illustrates how coherent sets of genetic interactions connect protein complex and pathway modules to map a functional wiring diagram of the cell.},

	abstract = {Biological networks are powerful resources for the discovery of genes and genetic modules that drive disease. Fundamental to network analysis is the concept that genes underlying the same phenotype tend to interact; this principle can be used to combine and to amplify signals from individual genes. Recently, numerous bioinformatic techniques have been proposed for genetic analysis using networks, based on random walks, information diffusion and electrical resistance. These approaches have been applied successfully to identify disease genes, genetic modules and drug targets. In fact, all these approaches are variations of a unifying mathematical machinery — network propagation — suggesting that it is a powerful data transformation method of broad utility in genetic research.},

	abstract = {A key challenge to transferring knowledge between species is that diﬀerent species have fundamentally diﬀerent genetic architectures. Initial computational approaches to transfer knowledge across species have relied on measures of heredity such as genetic homology, but these approaches suﬀer from limitations. First, only a small subset of genes have homologs, limiting the amount of knowledge that can be transferred, and second, genes change or repurpose functions, complicating the transfer of knowledge. Many approaches address this problem by expanding the notion of homology by leveraging high-throughput genomic and proteomic measurements, such as through network alignment.},

	abstract = {Machine learning on graphs is an important and ubiquitous task with applications ranging from drug design to friendship recommendation in social networks. The primary challenge in this domain is ﬁnding a way to represent, or encode, graph structure so that it can be easily exploited by machine learning models. Traditionally, machine learning approaches relied on user-deﬁned heuristics to extract features encoding structural information about a graph (e.g., degree statistics or kernel functions). However, recent years have seen a surge in approaches that automatically learn to encode graph structure into low-dimensional embeddings, using techniques based on deep learning and nonlinear dimensionality reduction. Here we provide a conceptual review of key advancements in this area of representation learning on graphs, including matrix factorization-based methods, random-walk based algorithms, and graph convolutional networks. We review methods to embed individual nodes as well as approaches to embed entire (sub)graphs. In doing so, we develop a uniﬁed framework to describe these recent approaches, and we highlight a number of important applications and directions for future work.},

The translation of synthetic lethality to therapy will be assisted by the synthesis of genetic interaction data from model organisms, tumour genomes and human cell lines.},
